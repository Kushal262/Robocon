THEME  
The theme for ABU Robocon 2026, “Kung Fu Quest ”, invites teams to embark on an exhilarating robotic 
journey that celebrates the timeless art of Kung Fu and the pursuit of excellence. Set against the backdrop 
of an ancient martial arts tradition, this competition symbolizes the path of a Kung Fu disciple striving to 
achieve mastery through discipline, strategy, and teamwork. Each team, consisting of two robots, will 
navigate a dynamic arena where they must collab orate to assemble powerful weapons, collect sacred 
Kung -Fu Scrolls, and engage in a strategic Tic -Tac-Toe showdown. This journey mirrors the rigorous 
training and mental fortitude required to earn the title of a Kung Fu master, blending cultural heritage w ith 
cutting -edge technology.  
The game begins with Robot 1 and Robot 2 working in unison to gather resources, reflecting the harmony 
and coordination essential in martial arts practice. As they construct weapons, teams demonstrate 
precision and ingenuity  that are  key virtues of Kung Fu. The quest for Kung -Fu Scrolls unfolds in the Meihua 
Forest, a multi -tiered test inspired by the iconic Meihua Blossom Poles, a cornerstone of Chinese Martial 
Arts training. Traversing these levels demands stability, precisio n, and foresight, much like a martial artist. 
In the game, Robot 2 must autonomously identify the correct Scrolls, chart an optimal path, and execute 
the task with confidence and agility. The climactic Tic -Tac-Toe match tests their strategic prowess, where  
every move counts, echoing the intellectual depth of martial arts philosophy. This theme not only honours 
the legacy of Kung Fu but also inspires innovation, encouraging participants to push the boundaries of 
robotics while respecting tradition.  
This com petition promises to be a celebration of skill, culture, and technological advancement, leaving a 
lasting legacy for future generations of robot enthusiasts.  
THE IMPORTANCE OF SAFETY  
Safety is the highest priority in ABU Robocon. Teams must prioritize safe ty during all stages, including 
robot design, manufacturing, and contest participation. Full cooperation with organizers is required to 
ensure a safe environment for everyone involved (team members, spectators, officials,  and the 
surroundings. All team members must wear organizer -specified safety gear during games and practice 
sessions.  
Contest  
All domestic competitions selecting teams for ABU Robocon 2026 Hong Kong, China must adhere to the 
rules in this rulebook. However, if specified materials are una vailable for domestic contests, local 
organi sers should use the best possible replacements available in their country/region.
